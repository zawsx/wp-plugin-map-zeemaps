Create and customize an interactive Google Map using ZeeMaps and then easily publish it in your blog post.

== Description ==

With a few simple clicks, you can post a customized, interactive Google Map in your
blog. Follow these simple steps to post your map:

* Go to the ZeeMaps server (http://www.zeemaps.com) and create your map
* Add markers, regions to your map
* Add one marker at-a-time, using Additions->Add Marker menu item, or use Additions->Upload CSV to add multiple markers from a CSV file or Google Spreadsheet
* After your map is done, note the map number for your map (the number on the map URL after the parameter *group=*)
* Make sure you have the ZeeMaps plugin downloaded and activated
* Go to edit your blog entry
* In the second row for your blog editor menu buttons, you should see a new button with the Google marker icon
* Place your cursor in the location where you want to publish your map in the editor window
* Click on the Google marker icon button
* Enter your map number and customize your published map in the resulting dialog
* Click on the insert button

This should add some text to your blog like:

 [zeemaps 45 w=100% h=500 add geosearch]

This text will be replaced by the map in your blog.
